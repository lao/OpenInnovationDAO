# OpenInnovationDAO [name to be changed]

## Intro

The idea of this DAO is to serve as a Democratic innovation deparment manager.

## Main caracteristics/flow

- Budget is started by an organization (`@wetransfer.com` for example)
- Projects are all candidates to win a budget
- Any company member, with a `@wetransfer.com` can submit project for `WeTransfer` organization
- There will be a voting round, where all registered users from on organization will be able to vote
- After the election closing, projects will be selected and a round of selecting project members will start
- Project members should be select democratically via a queue or etc (How to vet tech skills and etc?)
- Once projects members are fullfilled, budget is released.


## To define:

### Auth

- Problem:        How are we making sure only real allowed users can vote and vote only once?
- Possibility 1:  email company address + token generated by the DAO?

``` 

### Project member submission
TODO:
- queue of members for each project
- try to find a very democratic way to select engineers, designers, project managers, business analists and etc.
- voting maybe?

# GENERAL TODO

- finish the flows and graphs
- have a flow for submitting project constraints per each company (voted by the users)
- having a time window to vote and start a project (constraint)
- as authenticated you could volunteer to work on a project
- [] decentralized CV and validator of professional skills
