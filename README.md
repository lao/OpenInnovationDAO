# OpenInnovationDAO [name to be changed]


## To define:

### Auth

- Problem:        How are we making sure only real allowed users can vote and vote only once?
- Possibility 1:  email company address + token generated by the DAO?


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Unauthorized User->>+AuthenticationChecker: initial registration (email with company domain)
    AuthenticationChecker-->+Unauthorized User: validation errors
    AuthenticationChecker->>+Unauthorized User: confirmation email with code (how-to wallet)
    Unauthorized User->>+AuthenticationChecker: connect wallet with email confirmation code
    AuthenticationChecker-->+Unauthorized User: validation errors
    AuthenticationChecker->>+DataManager: valid user: save user data
    DataManager->>+DataManager: data to store user data (wallet + email - where to store this?)
    DataManager->>+AuthenticationChecker: ok
    AuthenticationChecker->>+Unauthorized User: ok
```

### Project submission

```


### Budget registration

    OpenInnovationDAO->>+WeTransfer:        send message to all users that a new budget
```

### Project voting

```mermaid

    VotingRegistry->>+AuthorizedUser: show details and prompt for comfirmation (id to confirm)
    AuthorizedUser->>+VotingRegistry: confirm with id
    VotingRegistry->>+AuthorizedUser: ok (vote id)
``` 

### Project member submission
TODO:
- queue of members for each project
- try to find a very democratic way to select engineers, designers, project managers, business analists and etc.
- voting maybe?

# GENERAL TODO

- finish the flows and graphs
- have a flow for submitting project constraints per each company (voted by the users)
- having a time window to vote and start a project (constraint)
- as authenticated you could volunteer to work on a project
- [] decentralized CV and validator of professional skills
